**Titanic Data Analysis by Vaishnav Nigade 2022BCD0045 

**Overview**

The Titanic dataset provides a rich resource for exploring the factors
 that influenced survival on the famous 1912 voyage of the RMS Titanic. 
 This project aims to analyze the dataset using various data science 
 techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis 
 (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning, to predict survival
  outcomes. By identifying key patterns and correlations, the project 
  demonstrates how predictive models can be applied to historical data 
  for classification tasks.
**Project Description**

This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a predictive model that forecasts the survival of passengers based on various features such as age, sex, class, and embarkation port. The analysis and model development process involves multiple stages, including:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data and identifying trends or patterns that might affect survival.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that could improve the performance of the machine learning model.
Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to train the model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Technologies Used**

      Python: The main programming language used for developing the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebooks: For running and documenting the entire project workflow.

**Data Description**

The Titanic dataset consists of the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Pclass: The class of the ticket (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
Name: Name of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: The number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: The number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: The fare paid for the ticket.
Cabin: Cabin number (some values are missing).
Embarked: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).
Survived: The target variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).

**Model Development  Vaishnav Nigade 2022BCD0045

The project follows these stages to develop the predictive model:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values: Imputing missing values for Age and Cabin columns.
Encoding categorical features: Encoding Sex and Embarked columns using one-hot encoding.
Scaling numerical features: Standardizing features like Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch.
Feature Engineering:

Extracting titles from names (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.) and creating a new feature for Title.
Creating a feature for family size by combining SibSp and Parch.
Model Training:

Several machine learning models are tested, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Hyperparameters are tuned for each model using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to improve accuracy.
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using a test set, and the following metrics are calculated:
Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Visualizations include confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Visualization:

Data visualizations to understand distributions and correlations.
Feature importance plots to interpret the models.
**Training the Model**

To train the model, follow these steps:

Load the dataset: Use Pandas to load the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.
Preprocess the data: Clean, transform, and scale the data to make it suitable for model training.
Split the data: Use Scikit-learn's train_test_split to divide the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Choose a model: Train models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest.
Evaluate the model: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use cross-validation for robust evaluation.
Save the trained model: Save the final model using joblib or pickle for future use.

**Evaluation**

After training the model, we evaluate its performance using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of actual positive cases identified correctly.
F1-Score: A balanced measure combining precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
The project's outcome is a robust model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features, which could be used in other domains where prediction models based on structured data are required.
